# Your title

This is a template for writing mixed code and text sections of the Elara Handbook. Everything in here can be edited both as source (i.e. in a code editor) as well as the Jupytext interface using Jupyter notebooks. Here is an example of an executable code block:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# write executable code here
print("Hello World")
```
