# The Elara Handbook

**Welcome to Project Elara!** Project Elara is a mission of a team of committed scientists, engineers, and talented people, working across many different fields, to pass down a better world to our future generations.

## Who we are

We choose to believe in the power of **hope** and we work so that our future descendants can live in a world that we would hope to give them, one where our planet is at peace, and where a quality life is guaranteed to every human being.

These are indeed lofty goals, and we realize that even trying to do so at all is hardly simple. Therefore, we work as a team, across nations and across generations, to accomplish this mission together. To advance, share, and preserve our collective knowledge and expertise, and to build on each other's work, we have put together this book. It is not simply an encylopedia, an open research repository, a wiki, a work of technical documentation, a manifesto of thought, a developer log, a book on software, a textbook, or a manual; it is _all of these_. Everything you'd ever need to learn, develop, or contribute to Project Elara can be found here. And we dedicate this book to not only the ones dear to us, but also to the world.

```{note}
The handbook is actively developed and in some sense it will never be "complete", as it is a continuous work with no singular author and will only grow with time. Information within this handbook can update rapidly. If you find any errors or problems, please report them to us at <https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-handbook/issues>. Thank you very much!
```

```{admonition} Found any inaccuracies in our Handbook?
:class: tip
Please let us know so that we can improve the Handbook! Just file a report at our issues tracker at <https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-handbook/issues> and we will fix it once we can.

## The newcomer's guide

If you're new to the Project, we are very glad to have you join us! To get started, please read {doc}`basics/about/quickstart-guide`, which contains a complete, step-by-step guide on getting started with the Project.

Once you've gotten started, reading the Elara Handbook is the recommended way to learn more about the science behind our work. That said, we understand that reading technical and scientific documentation can easily be quite confusing, so we have organized the Handbook to be as easy as possible to get started, and to require **minimal prerequisite knowledge and background** to read.

First, if you are **unfamiliar with calculus, introductory physics, or computer programming (in at least one language)**, we highly recommend you to start from the first chapter, "The Basics". This has two main parts. The first part explains the Project, its mission, and its work. The second covers basic algebra, trigonometry, differential equations, vectors, matrices, and multivariable calculus. If you just need a refresher on one of these topics, it's completely okay to skip a section and move on to the next. After finishing "The Basics", we recommend that you continue on to the second chapter, "The Specifics". This covers the majority of the Project's research and development, as well as the technical prerequisites. While reading everything in this chapter will provide you with a thorough understanding on which to do research, we understand that is not for everyone, so read according to your interests and time.

Second, if you have a **good familiarity with calculus, introductory physics, and computer programming (in at least one language)**, we recommend just reading the first part of "The Basics" (the first chapter). The second part, which covers the math, physics, and programming prerequisites, is not necessary to read, although it may be helpful to skim through. Afterwards, we highly encourage reading through as much of "The Specifics" (the second chapter) as possible. This section covers all the theoretical and applied foundations for understanding the Project's core research, _and_ explains the Project's research. However, it is not necessary to read anything beyond the second chapter.

Third, if you have a **keen interest in theoretical or computational physics, and a strong math and physics background**, we recommend reading the first part of "The Basics" (the first chapter), then jumping straight to "The Expert's Guide" (the third chapter). This chapter is about numerical methods, scientific computing, general relativity, and relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as working on research that pushes the boundaries of modern physics.

Fourth, if you are a **developer and just want to work on code**, we recommend reading the first part of "The Basics", and then jumping straight to the "Developer" section of "The Expert's Guide" (the fourth chapter). You may then choose to read whichever parts suit your interest and the work you plan to do.

We are so grateful for each and every one of our members, and everyone's contributions, **no matter how small**, will be added to the "Contributions" portion at the end of the book. Your work brings us one step closer to changing the world for the better.

### FAQs

- I don't understand the code within the Handbook. What is it there for?
	- Many pages in the Handbook contain **inline code** that does scientific calculations, generates graphs and plots, or solves particular equations. You **do not** need to understand them, but we will go over programming within the Handbook so that the code makes more sense.
- Why is there so much incomplete/misplaced/undecipherable content?
	- We are a small team and though we want to produce documentation and work of the highest quality, our time constraints mean that the Handbook does have sections that seem out of place or are far too rushed. The Handbook is a work-in-progress and we _highly encourage_ reporting any issues you find to our issues tracker at <https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-handbook/issues>.
- Do I have to read through everything? This seems like a lot and I'm not sure I can read this much.
	- No, you **don't** have to read any more than you feel comfortable with! It's okay to skip sections or read only a small portion of the Handbook. We wrote this Handbook to be comprehensive because (among other reasons) we wanted to explain everything possible so that someone reading wouldn't get lost when we explain our research. But there is no need to learn everything or read it all!
- I'm reading the PDF version of the Elara Handbook and I notice a bunch of stuff that doesn't look like it should be there or weirdly-formatted stuff. What's that about?
	- The web version of the Elara Handbook is the primary version (for now) and it includes internal links and HTML content that doesn't always translate super well to PDFs. While we try to make the two compatible, we unfortunately haven't had the time to look over _everything_. Again, we encourage you to report issues you find to our issue tracker (the link is given above).
- The chapter numbers in the PDF don't line up to the web version or the titles in the Handbook, why is that?
	- Our PDF generator tool works in a way that doesn't distinguish between actual _chapters_ and introductory pages. We are trying to figure out a way to solve this issue, but it will take some time, and again, please report this issue (and any similar ones) so we know which places need fixing.

## Quickstart for developers

[Skip past developer section](#license)

Wanting to edit and add to the Handbook? This book is written using [Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/), a Python-based tool for making scientific books containing runnable code. The source code is hosted on the Project Elara GitHub at <https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-handbook>. To edit the Handbook, ensure you have Git installed, and then clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-handbook
cd elara-handbook
```

To build the book locally, ensure you have Jupyterbook installed, then, with a terminal open to the **root directory of the repository**, run:

```sh
# You MUST run this in the ROOT of the Git repo
jupyter-book build book/
```

Then you can start writing! We recommend using a markdown editor like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which makes editing _much_ more convenient, but this is not strictly necessary. Simply follow the below instructions:

- To write a new section, first switch to a new editing branch with `git checkout -b YOUR_NEW_BRANCHNAME` (replace `YOUR_NEW_BRANCHNAME` with an appropriate name for the branch as you see fit)
- Copy a template from the `templates/` folder in the repository root and copy it into one of the directories (e.g. `basics/`, `specifics/`, etc.)
- Then rename it to a suitable name and add the filename to `_toc.yml` located in the repository root in the appropriate section
- You can now start editing! Remember to commit and open a pull request on github (github provides automated tools for this on its website) so we can add in your changes!

Elara Handbook can also be built as a standalone PDF. For this, you'll need to have [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) installed - we recommend using the [MikTex installer for LaTeX](https://miktex.org/) to install LaTeX - as well as the `make` utility installed (on most Linux OS's this should already be preinstalled, on macOS you need to install it with `xcode-select --install`, and on Windows follow the instructions at [Make for Windows](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or install it from [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)). To build the book PDF, make sure you're in the root directory of the repository, then simply run:

```sh
jupyter-book build book --builder latex
```

```{tip}
If you choose to use the Obsidian markdown editor, just open the `book/` subfolder of this repository as a vault, and then you can edit it like any other Obsidian markdown vault. In addition, we highly recommend installing the [obsidian-latex](https://github.com/wei2912/obsidian-latex) plugin, as it provides support for custom LaTeX commands (such as `\unit` for typesetting physical units) that are not shipped with Obsidian by default. We have already set up a LaTeX snippets file that should load automatically upon installing the plugin, so you can get started as fast as possible.
```

### More developer information

```{note}
For developers working **on Windows**, it is _highly recommended_ to configure Git to automatically handle line-endings via `git config --global core.autocrlf true` before editing anything. See [this article here](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/crlf-vs-lf-normalizing-line-endings-in-git/) which explains why it is necessary.

    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
