# Theoretical physics

As well as its main work on space-based energy research, Project Elara also conducts theoretical physics research (on a much, much smaller scale). While the applications of our work in this area are far from the realm of possibility in the present, we hope it will be useful for our descendants in the far future. In this spirit, we work to pass on our knowledge to the benefit of those who come after us, and explore concepts and ideas - even those that are speculative, or might turn out to be dead ends - that can advance our knowledge of science and hopefully bring benefit to humanity. Some of the speculative theoretical concepts we study include the following:

- Laser perturbation of the quantum vacuum for the production of exotic matter for artificial applications
- Creating a kugelblitz (artificial black hole) and harnessing black hole energy through (a) black hole energy collection swarms and (b) superradiance reactors
- Spacetime metric engineering including warp drives (and variations thereof), wormholes, and other forms of gravitational engineering
- Numerical relativity using machine learning

Research into these topics require a strong knowledge of general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics (including quantum field theory). The following sections give an overview of the necessary theoretical background in these topics.
