# Theoretical physics

As well as our main work on space-based energy research, Project Elara also conducts theoretical physics research (on a much, much smaller scale). While the applications of our work in this area are presently far outside the realm of possibility, we hope it will be useful for our descendants in the far future, living perhaps hundreds, if not thousands of years from now.

In this spirit, we preserve and pass on our knowledge in this Handbook to the benefit of those who come after us, and explore concepts and ideas - even those that are speculative, or might turn out to be dead ends - that can advance our knowledge of science and hopefully bring benefit to humanity. Some of the speculative theoretical concepts we study include the following:

- Laser perturbation of the quantum vacuum for the production of exotic matter for space travel
- Creating a kugelblitz (artificial black hole) and harnessing black hole energy through (a) black hole energy collection swarms and (b) superradiance reactors
- Spacetime metric engineering including warp drives (and variations thereof), wormholes, and other forms of gravitational engineering
- Numerical relativity using machine learning

Research into these highly theoretical topics require a strong knowledge of general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics (which includes quantum field theory). The following sections give an overview of the necessary theoretical background in these topics.
