# Theoretical research overview

In our theoretical work, we study the very cutting-edge of physics, and physics under the most extreme conditions, in the hopes that they may lead to technologies that can be built by future generations.

## Our work in high-energy physics

Above the [Schwinger limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit), very intensive electric fields with field strengths $\pu{10^{18} V/m}$, the quantum electrodrodynamical vacuum breaks down, allowing matter to be produced directly from the vacuum - this is known as the [Schwinger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_effect). While purely theoretical at the moment, very-high-power lasers currently being built may be able to exceed the Schwinger limit.

Any matter produced by the Schwinger effect is likely to be extremely miniscule in amount. However, any such matter would in theory gravitate, exerting what may be thought of as an "attractive pull" towards other matter, like a suction pump. This can be described as a negative gravitational pressure, and can be effectively modelled with a _negative_ energy density in the stress-energy tensor. And by the Einstein equations $G_{\mu \nu} = \kappa T_{\mu \nu}$ this would mean a _negative_ Einstein tensor, and thus a negative curvature of spactime. The physical effects of this scenario would be bizarre; instead of experiencing a attractive gravitational force, massive particles would experience a _repulsive_ gravitational force. At the moment, this is purely theoretical; but this is the heart of the Alcubierre drive concept, as well as other conceptual technologies based on advanced theoretical physics.
