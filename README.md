The Elara Handbook is Project Elara's open knowledge repository and documentation. Everything you'd ever need to learn, develop, or contribute to Project Elara can be found here!

:warning: The handbook is actively developed and will not be complete for quite a while. Patience is appreciated!

## About the Handbook

The Elara Handbook is written in Markdown and Jupyter notebooks using [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/).

We recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for editing the markdown source. Open the `book/` directory in Obsidian as a vault of existing files, and then you can edit as usual.
